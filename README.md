# gpu-driver-swap

gpu-driver-swap is a systemd service to automatically swap AMD / Nvidia drivers on boot. It allows proprietary AMD and Nvidia drivers to be installed side-by-side, and automatically sets up the correct drivers at boot depending on which card is plugged in.

## Requirements

* systemd-based distribution (see [Installing on SysV distributions](#installing-on-sysv-distributions))
* Proprietary AMD and Nvidia drivers

## Installation

    # make install
    # systemctl enable gpu-driver-swap.service

## Configuration

*gpuswap.sh* contains several configuration variables for both AMD and Nvidia cards:

* `libglx_path` - GLX shared library to use (usually *libglx.so.xxx.xx* for Nvidia and *fglrx-libglx.so* for AMD)
* `libgl_path` - OpenGL shared library to use (usually *libGL.so.xxx.xx* for Nvidia and *fglrx.libGL.so.x.x* for AMD)
* `xorg_path` - Xorg config file to use - try and put as much shared stuff in */etc/xorg/xorg.conf.d* as possible, and only put `Device` sections in *xorg.conf*
